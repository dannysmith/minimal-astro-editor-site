> On two occasions I have been asked, — "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out ?" In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.– _[Charles Babbage](https://archive.org/details/passagesfromlife03char/page/67/mode/1up), Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, 1864_

Saw this on [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/2/charles-babbage/)'s blog. Seems _extremely_ relevant in the world of AI!
