# Testing Timestamp Filename Format jhello helloffff

This article uses a timestamp-based filename to test how the editor handles different naming conventions.

<Callout type="info">
This file demonstrates how the editor should handle various filename formats while displaying proper titles from frontmatter. Typing here is nice bro. `one` thing is cool
</Callout>


This is cool

## Filename Testing Scenarios hello hello there

This tests several important behaviors: hello

### 1. Filename vs Title Display
- **Filename**: `1709876543210-timestamp-filename-format.mdx`
- **Title**: "Testing Timestamp Filename Format"
- **Expected**: Editor should display the title, not the filename

### 2. MDX Component Support
This article uses MDX format to test component rendering:

<Callout type="warning">
The editor should properly handle MDX files and their custom components.
</Callout>

### 3. Different Naming Conventions
Projects often use different naming conventions:
- Timestamp-based: `1709876543210-title.md`
- Date-based: `2024-03-08-title.md`
- Slug-based: `article-title-slug.md`
- Simple: `title.md`

## Component Testing

<Callout type="success">
This callout tests the MDX component system and how it integrates with the editor.
</Callout>

The editor should:
1. Recognize this as an MDX file (show MDX badge)
2. Handle the custom imports properly
3. Display components correctly in preview
4. Maintain component syntax when editing

## Content Organization

Using timestamp filenames can be useful for:
- **Unique identification**: Avoiding filename conflicts
- **Chronological sorting**: Natural filesystem ordering
- **Import systems**: Some CMSs prefer timestamp IDs
- **Migration scenarios**: Converting from other systems

However, the editor should prioritize human-readable titles in the UI while preserving the actual filename structure.

<Callout type="info">
The file list should show "Testing Timestamp Filename Format" as the title, with the actual filename shown in smaller text below.
</Callout>

This tests the balance between technical file organization and user-friendly display.
