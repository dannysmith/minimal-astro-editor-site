# Draft Article with Minimal Frontmatter

This is a draft article that only includes the minimum required fields to test:

This is 

1. **Required field handling**: Only title and pubDate are provided
2. **Draft detection**: Should show draft badge
3. **Optional field behavior**: No optional fields present
4. **Form generation**: Should show empty optional fields in editor
5. **Minimal content**: Short content for testing

## Why This Tests Important Scenarios

Many real articles start as drafts with minimal frontmatter and content. This tests:

- How the editor handles articles with only required fields
- Whether optional fields can be added through the UI
- If draft status is properly detected and displayed
- Form validation with minimal data

The editor should allow adding optional fields like description, tags, cover image, etc. through the frontmatter panel.

## Short Content

This article intentionally has minimal content to test how the editor handles shorter articles and whether the interface adapts appropriately.
